Hello! This is a Hello Kitty themed version of Flappy Bird using C#, specifically Blazor and .NET. 
Here the user plays as Hello Kitty and must tap/click repeatedly to keep the character from falling to the ground. 
The player must successfully fit through all of the pipe gaps without hitting any of them, or else there will be a game over.
There is a scoreboard that keeps track of the player's score during the game.
The gameover screen displays the player's score and highest score. It also allows for the user to replay the game!
To run, press the run button on Visua Studio :)
